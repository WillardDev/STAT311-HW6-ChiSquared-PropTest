# STAT311 Homework 6 – Chi-Squared & Proportion Hypothesis Tests

This repository contains the R code submission for STAT 311 Homework 6. The assignment includes hypothesis testing using chi-squared tests for categorical data and difference in proportions tests using normal approximation.

## 📄 Contents

- `STAT311-HW6.R` – Main R script with solutions to all questions.
- `STAT311-HW6.pdf` – Assignment instructions provided by the course.

## 🧪 Topics Covered

### Question 1: Vehicle Theft Analysis
- Chi-squared goodness-of-fit test to evaluate whether vehicle thefts occur uniformly across the days of the week.

### Question 2: Dice Fairness Evaluation
- Chi-squared test to determine whether the observed distribution of dice rolls matches the expected distribution for fair dice.

### Question 3: Voter Survey on Community College Support
- Hypothesis testing for the difference in proportions of voter support using a normal approximation.
- Confidence interval estimation.
- Z-statistic and p-value computation.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
